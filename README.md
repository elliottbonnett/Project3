Mole Mash
This is the app I built for computer science project 3.  It is a mobile game where the user tries to hit a mole that pops up on the screen.  The mole moves every half second.  USers score one point every time they hit the mole.  There is a scorre keeper in the lower left of the screen, along with a reset button that will reset the game and the score.
